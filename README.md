# Message Encryption and Decryption
As we know that today hackers are almost at every corner in search of our useful data which can be hacked by them for their different purposes. Even the risk gets doubled when come to the data of any country’s government. So, a system or terminology is must require to make that data safe forever by any means during communication. So the main aim of the project is to secure our important data from hackers and keep it safe.

Many organizations today are facing difficulties in choosing the best encryption and decryption algorithms for incorporating data security, confidentiality, and integrity in their businesses. Organizations need huge budget for analyzing the encryption processing overhead of a variety of cryptographic algorithms that are available in the market today

This project is all about the Data Security. How we can secure our data from hackers.The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm. The symmetric-key block cipher plays an important role in data encryption. It means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. 

In this project, we’ll see how to implement AES encryption and decryption using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) within the JDK.

### Features of AES Algorithm

* Block encryption implementation. 
* 128-bit group encryption with 128, 192 and 256-bit key lengths.
* Symmetric algorithm requiring only one encryption and decryption key.
* Data security for 20-30 years.
* Worldwide access. 
* Easy overall implementation.


### Requirements:
